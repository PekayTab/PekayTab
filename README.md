## Resume

I love coding and working with computers. I've always been interested in robots, engineering and tons more. I work well with others and have good communication skills. I also am very good at problem-solving. I enjoy programming and working with computers in general. I am always eager to learn new things and I tend to be a fast learner. I am always willing to do projects, if you are interested feel free to contact me via the [Contact](#Contact) section.

### Salmon

[Salmon](https://github.com/Salmon-Hosting) is a Minecraft host with a fully custom front-end UI and a partially custom backend. We use:

- Laravel(PHP) with Vue and SCSS for our website and panel which I wrote myself
- Typescript/Discord.js for our Discord bot which I wrote myself
- Laravel and Go for the API and backend which I've helped write
- Custom additions to the Pterodactyl instance which I've helped write
- Next Js/Sass for our future update on the panel
- Python for custom backend scripts for fetching server jars that I wrote

### Cloaks+

[Cloaks+](https://github.com/CloaksPlus) is a Minecraft add-on that allows you to get free Capes and Cosmetics on any Minecraft Client. I have contributed by writing Typescript Discord.js for our Discord bot which I manage, maintain, and help to add new features.

### Senior Studios

[Senior Studios](https://seniorteam.net/) is a service provider for a wide range of Minecraft-related services. I work as a freelancer and do System administrator and Web Development commissions. This helps to earn some side cash and also grom my experience and find what I'm good at.

### Discord Bots

I do discord bot commissions for friends and anyone who reaches out to me.
I've done everything from simple webhooks all the way to bots with all of the following features.

- Verification system
- Temp Ban with logging
- Kick with logging
- Ticket system
- Button roles
- Suggest command
- Mute with logging
- Embed command
- Giveaway function + reroll
- Anti curse system
- Meme command
- Automod system for anticurse and antiscam
- Custom command maker
- Leveling System

And lots more cool features!

### More

I'm always looking for more ways to challenge myself and learn new skills. As expected I sometimes get really interested in one random thing like making a custom driver run doom run on a 3x3 grid of 128x64 pixel OLED screens or making an external backup script for Minecraft servers, etc.

## Goals

In 2022 I want to learn more and expand my skills I hope to learn some of these things:

- Storybook
- Go
- C++
- C#
- C
